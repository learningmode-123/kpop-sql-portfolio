`WHERE rank = 1`  
`ORDER BY year, week;`

### **Intermediate**

4. Which artist appears most frequently in the dataset?

`SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS appearances`  
`FROM kpop_rankings`  
`GROUP BY artist`

`SELECT artist, AVG(rank) AS avg_rank`

### **Advanced**

6. Which year had the most new songs entering the chart?

`SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS num_number_ones`
